<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dheeraj Tallapragada and I am an incoming junior at Dublin High School.
  I currently have a 4.0 GPA and am excited to start of the next school year.
  Some activities I do at school include competing in the prestigious tennis team
  as a Varsity player. 
</p>

<p>Outside of school, I am a computer science enthusiast. I love
  working with computers and get excited whenever I hear about the latest 
  features of any piece of technology. I am familiar with the languages
  Swift, Python, Java, and after the course I am taking on Udemy, HTML, CSS, JS, 
  node.js, express.js, MongoDB, and much more! I am also considering to learn
  C# and C++.
</p>

<p>Overall, I am just a normal kid who likes to have fun. 
  I want to experiment with new things and be ahead of the competition.
  I love to work with AI, especially after getting accepted to the 
  InspiritAI summer program. I doubt I will ever lose the interest I have
  for computer science and technology in general, so that's that!
